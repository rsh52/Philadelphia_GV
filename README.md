# Philadelphia GV

Welcome to the **Philadelphia Gun Violence (GV) Dashboard**, I developed this using the [R Statistical programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) as a personal project to investigate gun violence incidents in my home city of Philadelphia and the United States at large. 
The *User Guide* tab will describe many of the same details, techniques, and assumptions as below.

### Data Sources

The Dashboard takes in data from Open Data Philly. Open Data Philly is self-branded as “the official open data repository for the City.” Data scraped from here does not look into “mass shooting” events and instead looks at all reported shooting incidents.

### Definitions & Assumptions

**Philadelphia, Pennsylvania Gun Violence:** 
- The Philadelphia map takes different considerations into account and does not restrict to only “mass shooting” events, specifically “city-wide shooting victims, including Police Officer-involved shootings.”
